Uncluttered directory for CNN work. Use the Conda environment pytorch3 here (or its copy, pytorch3copy, if pytorch3 
hasn't been updated based on useful changes to pytorch3copy).

Notable Contents:
    
    model1.py will be where my model (and functions it relies on etc.) is stored.

    training.py will be my training pipeline.

    inferencer.py will be my inference pipeline.

    inferencer2.py was created 1:21pm on 15/02/22 for a fresh script for carrying out inference on Ronchigrams and 
    plotting alongside them Ronchigrams calculated from labels predicted

    modelLogging logs model architectures used in each training run.
